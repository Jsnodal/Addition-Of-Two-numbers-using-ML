This project uses machine learning to predict the sum of two numbers. It generates random pairs of numbers and trains a Linear Regression model to learn the relationship between the inputs and their sum. After training, the model can predict the sum of any two new numbers. A Tkinter GUI is created where users can input two numbers, and the trained model will predict and display their sum. This project demonstrates basic machine learning concepts like data generation, model training, saving/loading models, and building a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions.
